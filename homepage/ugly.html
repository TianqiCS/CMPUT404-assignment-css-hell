    <h2>Who am I</h2>
    <p>Tianqi Wang, I am a fourth-year Computing Science undergraduate student at the <a href="https://ualberta.ca">University of Alberta</a>.
        I came from China, learning as an international student. Academically, I have maintained a sound GPA, my area of studies is broad,
        including but not limited to web development, software Engineering, machine learning, and game development.
        Professionally, I have been employed as frontend developer for nearly a year, mainly designing a quiz system with algebra math capability.
        Besides, I know a relatively large set of programming languages.

    <h2>A little bit of history</h2>
    <h4>Before 2016</h4>
    <p>
        I have had a interest of computers since I was very young. I enjoyed video games and it was always a pleasure to teach others how to use a computer.
        Before I got into UA, I even ran a Minecraft game server on the web, offering advance gameplay experience to more than 300 players. During the process,
        I started to learn programming and found it very fun. Finally, I chose to be a computer scientist instead of a physics scientist which I supposed to be in my home country.
    </p>
    <h4>2016-2017</h4>
    <p>
        I entered University of Alberta by 2016. Python was the first programming language I learnt.
        Its flexible data types and requirement of indentation were good for a beginner. Also, Python is also very powerful.
        With a large number of modules and resources from the web, some tasks can be done by only few lines of codes.
        It is also the most frequent language I used till now.
    </p>
    <h4>2017-2018</h4>
    <p>
        It is the second year of my university studies, when I gained much base knowledge.
        Algorithm was kind of hard to learn but it was very useful at many cases. Language C was more complex than Python but it was powerful and efficient.
        Databases were dull; however, it provided great features for storing, searching and modifying data.
        Mips assembly was super abstract but that how the computers work.
        I also did several group projects, they were never simple, and it did help me to learn working as a group. Teamwork is crucial in the jobs.
        It is not only the skill of programming but also the art of dealing with people that matters.
    </p>
    <h4>2018-2019</h4>
    <p>
        I started to learn deeper and think as a scientist. From now, most of the tasks were collaborated, I learnt some more advanced topics like software engineering and
        computer architecture. And I began to self-learning React.js and related web development stuff. It was a great fun to do some small projects. Meantime,
        I picked up Java, Cpp and Matlab in some courses.
    </p>
    <h4>2019-2020</h4>
    <p>
        There are a lot happened, I learnt quite much knowledge in machine learning and multimedia. I also keep learning web skills incrementally, and secured a job in May.
        I worked full time in the summer and part time when back school. Currently, I am taking web application course and learning how to write paper. I think I will go on and
        pursue a master degree in computing science.

    <h2>What I can do for you</h2>
    <h4>Web Application</h4>
    <p>
        I have the skills to develop full stack applications for your needs, whether it is a website or an android app. I can work alone as well as in a team, being a
        self-learner I can pick up new skills very quickly. Customer requirements are important, I will try to meet your requirements and providing suggestions as well.
        Some of the previous projects can be looked up at my github repositories.
